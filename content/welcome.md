Slug: welcome

Welcome to the Python class at The Iron Yard in Durham! We are going to have an amazing semester. You're going to need to do a few things to get ready before we start class on August 24:

* [Get and setup your Mac]({filename}/pages/mac.md)
* [Read through the syllabus]({filename}/pages/syllabus.md)
* [Complete your prework]({filename}/pages/prework.md)

The prework will take you quite some time -- probably around 40 hours -- so don't wait until the last minute to start it. It is due one week before class on August 17.
