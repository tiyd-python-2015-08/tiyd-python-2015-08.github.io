## Schedule

Class is from August 24 to November 13, 2015.

Lecture is from 9 AM to 12:30 PM Monday-Thursday, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end early.

Lab is from 1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday and 9 AM to 5 PM on Friday.

### Office hours and one-on-one instruction

A teacher or TA will be during lab times at minimum. You can schedule one-on-one time with either of us. After hours, we may be available in the classroom or in Slack, which we use for group communication.

### Holidays

No classes will be held on Labor Day (Monday, September 7). Students will be welcome to continue to use the campus on both days.

## Topics

Class topics are listed week-by-week below. However, this list is not definitive and we will reorder things based off how the class is going.

Each list of topics is a list of things students should be comfortable with at the end of that week.

### Week 1

By the end of this week, students should be comfortable with:

* Computational thinking
* Setting up your computer for development
* Data structures
* Control flow
* Organizing Python modules
* Using Git and GitHub to manage source code
* Debugging

### Week 2

* Testing your code
* Higher-order functions
* Recursion
* Exceptions
* Object-oriented programming

### Week 3

* Stochastic programming
* Randomness
* Monte Carlo simulations
* Plotting
* NumPy
* Simple statistics
* Basic statistical inquiry

### Week 4

* Regular expressions
* Loading and manipulating data with pandas
* Common data formats
* Publicly available data sets
* Data set quality
* Cleaning data sets

### Week 5

* Machine learning
* Bayesian statistics and classification
* Clustering

### Week 6

* HTML
* CSS
* Introduction to Django
* Relational databases
* Modeling
* Forms

### Week 7

* Advanced database design
* Deployment
* Building REST APIs

### Week 8

* JavaScript
* Consuming REST APIs
* Data visualization on the Web

### Week 9

This week is a week for review and catch-up. Things will fall through the cracks during the previous 8 weeks, and so we have this week as a flex week to make sure we cover everything you need.

Friday of this week will be **Pitch Day**. You will pitch your project ideas to the entire cohort (all the classes will be together) and then vote on your preferences. We will assign you to teams based on your preferences, and you can start work as soon as Friday evening.

### Weeks 10-12

During these weeks, final projects will be in full swing. Ad hoc lectures may occur, but they will be optional. You should be comfortable with:

* Breaking up features into distinct tasks
* Estimating the size of programming tasks
* Using Agile development to run a project
* Shipping early and often
* Pitching your work to others

## Assignments

### In-lecture Exercises

During breaks in the lecture during the first half of the course, you will be given exercises for practicing the content you've just learned. Sometimes I'll give you a set of tests, and you'll be asked to write code to make them pass. Other times you'll be given a blank slate to start from. In most cases, you won't have time to finish the exercises before I ask you to stop and throw away what you've done. This is normal (if not disconcerting) and will be somewhat liberating a few weeks in.

### Nightly Assignments

After classes on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, you'll be given an assignment. You’ll work on these during the lab time that afternoon, and it's expected that you won't finish them by 5pm. You'll be asked to work on these as individuals, but we encourage group discussion about solving the problems.

### Weekend Assignments

After classes on Thursdays, you’ll be given a substantially longer assignment. You'll usually work on these assignments in pairs (which we'll assign for you), and you'll occasionally be working with students from other courses. Lab time on Thursday afternoon and all day Friday will be dedicated to helping you with these. As above, we expect that you won't finish these by 5pm on Friday.

### Final Project

During the last three weeks of the course, you will be working on your capstone project, putting all you've learned into practice. You will be working with a group of 2-5 people on your project, and these groups CAN include students from the other courses. Projects that span multiple courses typically turn out the best.

During weeks 10, 11, and 12, you'll spend all of your time working on this project (minus some field trips and guest speakers). We will potentially have occasional lecture time, but it will be tailored to what you need to know for your project and will be optional.

This project must use Python in some fashion, although it will inevitably involve additional technologies. If you are not planning to spend much time on the visual user interface, I _highly_ suggest working with someone from another class to make your project visually appealing.

## Policies

### Absence policy

You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your graduation and enrollment in the job placement program is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast.

### Homework policy

Your homework is due by 6 AM on the day it is due. After that, it is late. If you regularly turn in your assignments late, your enrollment in the job placement program is forfeit and you may not be allowed to graduate.

We would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid incomplete attempts turned in on time are not considered late.


### Honor code

You are expected to do your own work. You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but if you copy and paste anything, you MUST understand every line of that code.

Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting job placement or expulsion.


## Code of conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class, Slack, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by talking to your instructor. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your instructor, speak with any Iron Yard instructor or staff member.

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**

* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard
community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Iron Yard community.

* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class. This includes, but is not limited to:

    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    * Unwelcome sexual attention.
    * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

* **When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.
